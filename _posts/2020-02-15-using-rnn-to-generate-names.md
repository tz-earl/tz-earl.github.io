While learning about sequence models as part of the [Deep Learning set of courses offered by deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) one of the exercises was to implement bits and chunks of code of a recurrent neural network that was trained on a set of known names of dinosaurs and then used to generate novel dinosaur-sounding names that don't exist.

The following diagram gives an overview of how this RNN works when generating names. There is actually just one cell that is repeatedly activated by a sequence of inputs, where time is moving from left to right. Each input **_x_** consists of a single English letter or a newline character (which is a separator for the names). Each input **_a_** represents internal state that depends on the part of the sequence previously seen.  Each output **_Å·_** is one letter chosen based on a probability distribution that was created by the training phase. The accumulation of these outputs forms a generated name.

I thought it would be a fun exercise to apply this RNN model to generate a different kind of name, namely, Old English-sounding people names.

I found a website with [a set of 299 Old English girls names]({{site.url}}/files/oe-girl-names.txt) and [a set of 300 Old English boys names]({{site.url}}/files/oe-boy-names.txt) that serve as training data. I used the girls and the boys names as separate data but also concatenated them into a combined data set.

Using the boys names, 40_000 training iterations, and default values for the other parameters resulted in the following output, with selected snapshots along the way.

The values of the loss function quickly flatten out, generating some names that sound pretty good! I especially like **Rawston**, **Raynord**, and **Worton**. The model also generated **Stanfield**, which is an existing name.

Using the girls names and the combined set yielded similar results. The first iterations more or less produce garbage, then the loss function drops fast and plausible names start to come out.

Some other names that came out of the combined set were **Reynora**, **Wyrth**, and **Lytira**.

I decided to try increasing the number of training iterations and the learning rate.

Increasing the iterations from 40_000 to 50_000 produced:

Finally, to 70_000 iterations, at which point most of the generated names looked very plausible.

I also tried decreasing the learning rate from the default value of 0.01 to 0.005.

**Later:** while in the midst of writing this blog post, I happened to discover the [blog post by Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) on recurrent neural networks in which he briefly describes using an RNN to generate general baby names. His post was written in 2015 so his work predated mine by several years, 8-D
