While learning about sequence models as part of the [Deep Learning set of courses offered by deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) one of the exercises was to implement bits and chunks of code of a recurrent neural network that was trained on a set of known names of dinosaurs and then used to generate novel dinosaur-sounding names that don't actually exist.
