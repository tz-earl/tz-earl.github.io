My friend Peter is an applied mathematician who did some work in fluid dynamics. He wrote MatLab code to implement a mathematical function that calculates a maximal value of a variable K given four variables as inputs. As an exercise I decided to try implementing that math function as some kind of machine learning model.

For my purposes it was not necessary to understand the physics of what the inputs and the outputs mean, although it should be noted that the math is somewhat complex in that it applies polynomials in various terms of higher powers.
I just treated the MatLab code as a black box that accepts certain inputs and generates corresponding outputs. My goal was to create a machine learning model that acts as an equivalent black box.

Peter provided a set of 549 inputs with their outputs as a representative sampling of what is generated by the MatLab code. K is the output and the other four columns are the inputs. What is shown in the table below are a few of those samples.

 </table>

The input theta ranges continuously from 0.5326 to 1.5708. (theta happens to represent angles from 30 degrees to 90 degrees but in radians.)

The inputs n and m have three possible discrete permutations:  (3, 2), (4, 3) and (9, 4).

The input h_star has three possible discrete values:  0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001.

The output is a real number ranging continuously from 0 to about 4.1. So this can be thought of as a multi-variate regression problem with a continuous real number output.

Of the 549 examples in the data set, I used 538 for training and 11 for testing. Initially, the data set was kept in its original order but the ordering was later randomized.

The 11 test examples were chosen in a more or less stratified way in order to represent the discrete and continuous possibilities for the inputs.
