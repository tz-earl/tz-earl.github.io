I am wrapping up a sprint as a volunteer scrum master with Silicon Valley Project Management, an organization that provides experiential learning through enhancing and building out a live website. The program has been a great introductory exposure to being a working SM. What follows are a few things I’ve learned and observed.

**&bull; Interleaving of backlog refinement with sprint planning**

In the Scrum Guide backlog refinement and sprint planning are presented as distinct, sequential events. However, in one of my first sprints we had a backlog refinement meeting, ran out of time before completing enough backlog items, then had to carry out both refinement and planning in an interleaved manner in a later sprint planning event. It was less than ideal to mix the two different kinds of activities.

Now we are scheduling more refinement meetings and striving to better anticipate how much refinement needs to be done and to do so on more of a regular cadence. This is especially needed because of the high turnover of developers within the scrum team along with the unavoidable uncertainty and unfamiliarity with the technology we are using.

**&bull; The scrum framework does not prescribe how to do backlog refinement, how often, and who exactly is involved**

In our organization the teams are experimenting with two levels of refinement. The first level is the product owner working with one or two developers who have been with the organization, know some of the backlog items, and can work with product owner to discuss and clarify them. These discussions happen first.

The second level is a more formal meeting for the entire team so that every team member is involved with this scrum event. This is also when point estimation takes place.

**&bull; Backlog refinement is a lot of work that can be ill-defined and messy**

But then I read somewhere that an essential part of a backlog item is the conversation about it. It’s not just the written text that comprises an item, it’s also the dialog to clarify the text and to arrive at a shared understanding of what it means and what work is entailed.
