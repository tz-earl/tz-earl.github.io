I am wrapping up a sprint as a volunteer scrum master with Silicon Valley Project Management, an organization that provides experiential learning through enhancing and building out a live website. The program has been a great introductory exposure to being a working SM. What follows are a few things I’ve learned and observed.

**&bull; Interleaving of backlog refinement with sprint planning**

In the Scrum Guide backlog refinement and sprint planning are presented as distinct, sequential events. However, in one of my first sprints we had a backlog refinement meeting, ran out of time before completing enough backlog items, then had to carry out both refinement and planning in an interleaved manner in a later sprint planning event. It was less than ideal to mix the two different kinds of activities.

Now we are scheduling more refinement meetings and striving to better anticipate how much refinement needs to be done and to do so on more of a regular cadence. This is especially needed because of the high turnover of developers within the scrum team along with the unavoidable uncertainty and unfamiliarity with the technology we are using.

**&bull; The scrum framework does not prescribe how to do backlog refinement, how often, and who exactly is involved**

In our organization the teams are experimenting with two levels of refinement. The first level is the product owner working with one or two developers who have been with the organization, know some of the backlog items, and can work with product owner to discuss and clarify them. These discussions happen first.

The second level is a more formal meeting for the entire team so that every team member is involved with this scrum event. This is also when point estimation takes place.

**&bull; Backlog refinement is a lot of work that can be ill-defined and messy**

But then I read somewhere that an essential part of a backlog item is the conversation about it. It’s not just the written text that comprises an item, it’s also the dialog to clarify the text and to arrive at a shared understanding of what it means and what work is entailed.

**&bull; Backlog items – focus drift**

We had an ongoing backlog item regarding an editor role for blog content. Initially the item was about both defining and using the process which the editor follows in order to edit the drafted content.

After the editing process had been applied in a couple of sprints and had settled a lot, the “weight” of the item shifted more to actually doing the editing.

So the question was, should we revise the description of the backlog item, or should we archive it and start one?

This kind of issue could arise for any kind of ongoing backlog item. In the beginning there may be some kind of startup phase where the task and how to do it is being defined and hashed out. Then the process stabilizes somewhat. Afterwards and for the indefinite future there is possible continued improvement and refinement as experience is accumulated, new things are learned, and the task evolves.

**&bull; Estimation is relative to the particular team and the particular team members**

There’s a mutual dependency. Estimates are also relative to a certain point in time. As learning and experience accumulate, a team becomes more capable. As a result, estimates of effort can become smaller.

**&bull; Dependencies between backlog items within a single sprint**

As a content editor, I had to coordinate with content writers on a different scrum team regarding draft and completion deadlines. We editors were dependent on them to get their backlog items sufficiently done so that we could start ours.

It's a simple example of how the bulk of our work was loaded towards the latter part of the sprint whereas others were expected to do their work earlier. So not only were we dealing with the time limits of a single sprint, we had to carefully coordinate timing and sequencing within the sprint itself across teams.

**&bull; Focus on the sprint backlog during daily scrums**

Our daily scrums have been going well, held in such a way that reminded me of someone’s suggestion that instead of the three questions that are commonly used – “what have you done, what are you planning to do, and any impediments” – keep the focus on the items in the sprint backlog, not on the developers. This helps prevent the daily scrum from devolving into a status reporting session.
