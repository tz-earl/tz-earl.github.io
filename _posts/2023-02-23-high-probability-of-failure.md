I have been reading again the book <em><strong>The Principles of Product Development Flow</strong></em> by Donald Reinertsen. His reasoning is so precise and so refreshing in how it debunks various ideas that are intuitively appealing but incorrect. There are well over a hundred principles that encapsulate his thinking and observations.

Here's one: <strong>"The Newsboy Principle: High probability of failure does not equal bad economics."</strong> 

In his example scenario a newsboy who sells hardcopy newspapers makes a profit of 50 cents on each newspaper that he sells and loses 25 cents on each paper he doesn't sell. What is the optimal number of newspapers he should keep in stock each day? It turns out that because of the asymmetry between the amount of profit and the amount of loss between papers sold and those not sold, the optimal amount is that he should run out of newspapers one-third of the time. 

You can forgive the specific outdated business situation because it makes such a good point about optimizing profits. Two-thirds of the time the newsboy has newspapers leftover. That could add up to a lot of unsold copies, yet the strategy is the most profitable!

The principle made me think of businesses where there is a large asymmetry between potential payoffs and potential losses.
