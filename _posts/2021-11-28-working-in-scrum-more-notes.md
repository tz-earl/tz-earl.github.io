I am now in my third sprint as a volunteer scrum master with Silicon Valley Project Management, an organization that provides experiential learning through enhancing and building out a live website. 

This posting is a follow up to my initial set of thoughts and lessons learned, published in this [previous post](https://tz-earl.github.io/2021/09/01/working-in-scrum-initial-notes.html).  


**&bull; Scrum masters should check in more personally and individually with developers to see if help is needed.**

This reminded me how my co-scrum master and I met one to one with each developer around the beginning of the first sprint I participated in as SM. That was great for getting to know the team members, doing a bit of relationship building ahead of time, and find out their goals and interests in our program. 


** See the book Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days, by Jake Knapp

(0)  Group items by category, e.g. improve how meetings are conducted.
(1)  Vote on the items, e.g. by using silent dot voting.
(2)  Prioritize items with high votes, e.g. by placing them along a horizontal line.
(3)  Place high-priority items by both impact and effort, e.g. use a four-quadrant chart.
(4)  Make chosen items actionable, e.g. brainstorm specific solutions and tasks for each such item.
(5)  Create and define backlog items, e.g. on a Kanban board for this team.


** For purposes of visibility and visualization, the burndown chart could be published in the team Slack channel after every daily scrum. 


** Team building activities such as the following.

Questions / Tasks:
1. Location
2. Guilty pop pleasures
3. Determine team name
4. Designate spokesperson

Create a one minute team cheer:
1. All shout team name
2. Short team chorus
3. Solo 'moments' - first half of the group
4. Group chorus repeats
5. Solo 'moments' - other half of the group
6. Group chorus repeats
7. All shout team name

The Team Cheer exercises was ridiculously fun and hilarious.


** Sometimes just agreeing on and setting a time for a recurring meeting is enough to build momentum and enable progress.


** The “lean coffee” format is a great way to host an open, agenda-less discussion.
