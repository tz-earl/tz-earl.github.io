As I write this, I have spent the past several months in studying machine learning, mostly at the conceptual level.

When I previously wrote a technical blog (see below) I found that coming up with explanations of interesting issues
and descriptions of troubleshooting bugs brought about more clarity and sharper understanding than I would have
had otherwise.

So my motivation in starting this blog is twofold: that a post here and there might be useful to someone else, and 
as part of my own learning process.

 **[Optimizely Module: Notes on Converting to Drupal 8](https://optimizely-to-drupal-8.blogspot.com/)**
 This was a technical blog I wrote from 2014 to 2017 when I was doing open source work on a module that
 was an extension of the Drupal content management system. The last few posts were not at all about Drupal.

**[Under the Baobab Tree in East Africa](https://diane-and-earl-in-tz.blogspot.com/)**
This was a blog of personal reflections I wrote from 2009 to 2013 while doing volunteer work abroad in Tanzania.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
