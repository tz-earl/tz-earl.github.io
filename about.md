As of this writing in the spring of 2021 I've switched direction, leaving software engineering behind since I was increasingly feeling that it was time for me set out on something different in my career.

That something different is agile product / project management, more specifically, becoming a scrum master. This makes good use of the better people skills and emotional intelligence I've developed over the years while also leveraging off my background in creating software.

When I started this blog I had spent several months in studying machine learning, mostly at the conceptual level.

With a previous technical blog I had found that coming up with explanations of interesting issues and descriptions of troubleshooting bugs brought about more clarity and sharper understanding than I would have had otherwise.

So my motivation in starting this blog was twofold: that a post here and there might be useful to someone else, and as part of my own learning process.

 **[Optimizely Module: Notes on Converting to Drupal 8](https://optimizely-to-drupal-8.blogspot.com/)**  
 This was a technical blog I wrote from 2014 to 2017 when I was doing open source work on a module that
 was an extension of the Drupal content management system. The last few posts were not at all about Drupal.

**[Under the Baobab Tree in East Africa](https://diane-and-earl-in-tz.blogspot.com/)**  
This was a blog of personal reflections I wrote from 2009 to 2013 while doing volunteer work abroad in Tanzania.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
